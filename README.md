After pulling a the  project from GitHub, installing the dependencies is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:-

1- Ensure Node.js is Installed: First, make sure Node.js is installed on the machine. You can check this by running node -v in the terminal. If Node.js is not installed, you can download and install it from Node.js official website. 
2- Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Open your terminal (Linux or macOS) or command prompt/PowerShell (Windows). Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to your project's root directory. This is the directory where the project’s package.json file is located.

3- Run npm install: Execute the following command
“npm install”

4 - This command reads the package.json and package-lock.json files in your project, and installs all the dependencies listed there. The package-lock.json file ensures that you install the same versions of the dependencies that were used in the project originally. Wait for Installation to Complete: The installation process might take a few minutes, depending on the number and size of dependencies. Once it's complete, all the necessary dependencies will be installed in the node_modules folder in your project directory. 


5 - Start Using the Project: After the installation is complete, you can start using the project or continue development. If the project includes scripts defined in the package.json file (like start, build, etc.), you can run these with npm (e.g., npm start).
